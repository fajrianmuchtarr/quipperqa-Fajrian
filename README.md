Thank you for giving me this kind of opportunity, 

So in this step, I want to describe how the automation test using cypress works. 

First Of all, make sure already install cypress and node js in Visual Studio Code

Then, you should clone this repo or download it manually into your local storage to check it.

After the clone/download process is completed, Open the VSCode and select OpenFolder

Afterward, open the "cypress" folder, scroll down and select the "integration" foldertechnical test.

Then you will see 8 test cases that I built for this technical test

In file Login1.js explain how the authentication work well

In file Login2.js explain how the system response when user using a wrong username and password

In file buy_item.js explain if user want to buy some item in the website

In file remove_item_from_cart.js explain if the user want to clean up the shopping cart

In file Sorting_Price_HILO.js explain if the user want to sorting item based on Price from High to Low
